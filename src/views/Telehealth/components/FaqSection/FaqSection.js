            Telehealth works in the same way as regular medical appointments.
            The difference is that Telehealth appointments are facilitated over
            the phone or online, instead of face to face.

            You can use Telehealth when your primary need is professional
            medical advice or the risk of serious medical illness is low. You
            can use Telehealth when you live in a remote location or has no time
            to wait in the crowded waiting room, or where particular medical
            specialists or GPs are out of reach.

            We need Telehealth because itâ€™s not always easy for patients to
            physically attend a medical appointment. We also need Telehealth
            because of patient mobility issues and the need for ongoing medical
            evaluation in an online or phone setting.

            Telehealth monitoring is the use of specific technology to allow
            doctors to interact with their patients in a safe, comfortable and
            ongoing presence. Telehealth monitoring reports, collects, transmits
            and evaluates patient health data through the use of electronic
            devices and doctor/patient interaction.

            Telehealth is definitely worth it, especially if you live in a
            remote location, experience mobility issues or are simply time-poor.
            Telehealth is just like a regular medical appointment, except that a
            Telehealth appointment is conducted online or over the phone by the
            same qualified and registered doctors.
